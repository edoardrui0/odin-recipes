        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Concha (Spanish, 'shell'), plural conchas, is a traditional Mexican sweet
            bread roll (pan dulce). Conchas get their name from their round shape 
            and their striped, seashell-like appearance. A concha consists of two 
            parts, a sweetened bread roll, and a crunchy topping (composed of flour, 
            butter, and sugar).

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Have each ingredient ready and measured (by weight) before starting, 
                    and thoroughly read the notes above. Mix the all-purpose flour, yeast,
                    sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer at medium speed, just to 
                    mix it well.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add the butter and mix well (using the stand mixer with the hook 
                    attachment), then mix in the eggs and vanilla extract and slowly 
                    pour the milk in little by little until the dough looks cohesive 
                    (you may need less or more milk, as some flours soak up more liquid 
                    than others). Keep beating the mixture for about 7 minutes at medium 
                    speed.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add a little more flour around the inside of the bowl (2-3 tablespoons), 
                    just enough for the dough to separate from the container. The dough 
                    should be soft and slightly sticky.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place the dough on your floured working table and knead it just 
                    enough to shape it into a ball.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place this ball in a large greased bowl to rest. Cover it with a 
                    plastic wrap (or wax paper) and a kitchen napkin. Let the dough 
                    rest in a warm place for about 2 hours until it doubles in size. 
                    I usually turn the light on in my oven and place the bowl inside, 
                    close to the light. Be aware that if your kitchen is cold, the 
                    dough will take longer to rise. Be patient and do not try to 
                    proceed to the next step until the mixture has doubled in size.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Making the Concha toppings</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, place it onto a floured
                    surface and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 
                    16 small balls (60 grams each). To shape the balls, lightly flour 
                    your hands and place each small ball on the working surface and 
                    gently press down with your hand, rotating your hand to form the balls.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place them onto greased baking sheets and continue until you’ve 
                    finished shaping all of the dough.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Using your hands, grease the top of each ball with a little 
                    shortening. Do not skip this step, as it will help the topping adhere 
                    to the dough.
                </li>

                <li>
                    To add the topping, flour your hands and divide the topping paste 
                    into 16 balls. Use your hands to press down on each one to form a 
                    small, flat circle (I like to use a sheet of plastic, like when 
                    making tortillas). Place this disk onto the ball of dough, and 
                    press it down very firmly.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Once you’ve finished placing the topping on the buns, use a 
                    concha cutter or a knife to decorate them with the traditional 
                    concha shape.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Allow the conchas to rise in a warm place until they are almost 
                    double in size. Depending on the temperature of your kitchen, 
                    this step could take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours. Do not leave 
                    them to rise any longer, because if you let them grow too much 
                    they will collapse inside the oven. Bake in a preheated oven at 
                    325º degrees for 20 minutes, or until the bottom of the conchas 
                    are lightly golden. If you are placing more than one baking sheet 
                    in your oven, rotate them after 10-12 minutes. Move the sheet on 
                    the bottom rack to the top rack and vice versa to have an even baking.
