        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A schnitzel is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by 
            pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded 
            before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is 
            made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Olive oil, canola oil or any high heat cooking oil to saute</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges to serve (don’t skip the lemons!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to Make Pork Schnitzel:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2″-thick cutlets. Line a 
                cutting board with plastic wrap, place cutlets in a single layer on 
                cutting board and cover with plastic wrap (this prevents splatter). 
                Pound cutlets with a meat mallet or the back of a heavy saucepan, 
                until 1/4″ to 1/8″ thick.</li>

            <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp garlic
                salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork 
                to beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups panko crumbs.</li>

            <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten 
                egg letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in 
                panko crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping process to keep 
                your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>

            <li>Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over medium 
                heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is 
                hot, add breaded cutlets a few at a time and sauté 3-4 minutes per 
                side or until cooked through. Reduce heat if cutlets are browning too 
                quickly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Cut into one to double
                check doneness – juices should run clear. Serve right away with lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
