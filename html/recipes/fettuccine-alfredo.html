        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley</li>    
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to 
                season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook 
                according to package instructions. 
            </li>

            <li>
                In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced 
                garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the 
                parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over
                heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.
            </li>

            <li>
                Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be 
                used to thin out the sauce.
            </li>

            <li>
                Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan
                cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese.
                Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.
            </li>

            <li>
                Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.
            </li>
