Hello! This will be my first The Odin Project project.
This project is titles "Odin-Recipes"

In this project, I will need to have a Home page displaying links to three different recipes. 

According to the instructions given on the assignment, I am to demonstrate my abilites to create a HTML boilerplate, with three other HTML files containing the recipes I will be using

On each recipe link, I am to include an image of the dish and one to two paragraphs worth of description. Following the description, there should be an unordered list with "Ingredients" and then an ordered list with "Steps"
